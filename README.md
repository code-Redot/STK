## Student Tool Kit -STK-

This is an Android application designed to provide convenient access to various services for university students. It aims to streamline common tasks and improve communication between students and the university administration. The app includes features such as an academic calendar, events calendar, part-time job postings and applications for students, event postings and browsing, news postings and browsing, club requesting and approval by instructors, notifications, degree planner service, and a "Rate Us" feature.  This is a Senior Student project.

## Features

- **Academic Calendar**: The application provides an interactive academic calendar that includes important dates such as registration periods, semester start and end dates, exam schedules, and holidays. Students can easily view and manage their academic schedule.

- **Events Calendar**: A dedicated events calendar is integrated into the app, displaying university-wide events, workshops, seminars, and social activities. Students can browse, bookmark, and receive notifications for events they are interested in attending.

- **Part-Time Job Postings and Applications**: The app allows employers to post part-time job opportunities specifically targeted towards students. Students can search and apply for these job postings directly through the application.

- **Event Postings and Browsing**: Students and organizations can create and post events within the app, providing details such as location, date, time, and description. Other students can browse and register for these events.

- **News Postings and Browsing**: The application features a news section where the university administration can post important announcements, news articles, and updates. Students can stay informed about the latest campus news and developments.

- **Club Requesting and Approval**: Students interested in starting a new club or organization can submit requests through the app. Instructors and administrators can review and approve these requests, allowing students to form officially recognized clubs.

- **Notifications**: The app sends push notifications to students for important events, academic deadlines, job opportunities, news updates, and club-related activities. This ensures that students stay informed and don't miss any crucial information.

- **Degree Planner Service**: The application provides a degree planner service that enables students to map out their academic journey. Students can plan their courses for each semester, track progress towards their degree requirements, and receive guidance on course selection and prerequisites.

- **Rate Us**: The "Rate Us" feature allows users to provide feedback and rate their experience with the app. This helps us understand user satisfaction and make improvements based on user feedback.
